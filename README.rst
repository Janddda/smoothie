Current state
-------------

This is a totally dummy project in its current state.
It really does nothing useful (yet looks cool).

It actually requires you to start:

    - A few (at least 2) rq workers on the "plugins" queue (as root).
    - smoothie

And, of course, having mongodb and redis running.
Access it at port 8080 (not yet configurable).
